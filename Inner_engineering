# Communicating clearly and effectively

 # If you do not like something, say it on the face of the person
 # Do not accumulate emotions over time
 # Stay in the present and communicate what you really want to express


# Dealing with negative emotions

 # Analyze the thought/image that passed through your mind
 # Close your eyes and take a deep breath in order to nullify that thought
 # When accumulated emotions tend to cause you anger, laugh it off (think of something funny)
